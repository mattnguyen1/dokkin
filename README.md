## Local Development

### Prerequisites:

This is what I have, so lower versions may or may not be supported.
  - Erlang 20
  - Elixir 1.6.1

### Starting the Phoenix web server

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix dev`. This will start your webpack-dev-server and start watching it. By default, the webpack-dev-server runs on port 8080.
  * Optionally, you can start the server with `iex -S mix dev` in order to run the server while in the REPL.

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
